## Cucumber/Gherkin and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
The main topic is the problem between programmers and none programmers communication, given the business people can have a hard time formulating excatly what they want from the programmers, and the features can be lost in the translation of those requirements. Through the use of Gherkin structure to make Behaviour driven development syntax, the none programmers can communicate in a way that's familiar to them, which also is clear in it's requirements to the programmer, that with cucumber can implement the very requirement into a testing environment with very little overheader.
